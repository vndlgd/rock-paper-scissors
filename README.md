## Project Description

This project is an implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using JavaScript and HTML. It was completed as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project's Foundations course.

## Game Description

Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game played between two players. The game has three possible outcomes: 

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

The objective of the game is to select a hand gesture that beats the gesture chosen by the opponent.

## Project Details

This project focuses on building a web-based version of Rock Paper Scissors. It utilizes JavaScript for the game logic and HTML for the structure. This project is still in progress, but the main features of the project include:

- Displaying the game options (rock, paper, and scissors) to the player.
- Allowing the player to select their choice by clicking on the corresponding option.
- Generating a random choice for the computer opponent.
- Determining the winner based on the game rules.
- Displaying the results to the player.
